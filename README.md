# pythonlist
Since tuples are immutable, it is easier or better to take advantage of the mutable nature of lists to append data from user input.
We first create an empty list and later append user data to it. While loop is added to allow the addition of more items into the list.
See to it that the user enters integer values only for the cases of id_no and plot_no.
